ragent is my Rust learning project (so it's implementation sucks, PRs, issues and suggestions welcome).

ragent is my own monitoring agent:

* It works with Nagios (with check_ragent)
* It is as simple and lightweight as possible

DISCLAIMER

* I am a complete noob on Rust
* I have no idea about packaging. The rpm and deb are TERRIBLE

USAGE

$ ragent

Will start ragent listening at *:21488

$ check_ragent http://host:21488/

Will contact a ragent instance at http://host:21488/ and generate output/perfdata/return code following Nagios guidelines.

WHAT'S MONITORED

* It verifies that no filesystem's free space is less than 2 GB or 20% free (warning) or less than 1 GB/10% (critical)
* It verifies that no filesystem's free inodes are less than 20% free (warning) or less than 10% free (critical)
* It verifies that no SystemD unit is in failed state (critical, or use --warning-units to define units which will only generate warnings)
* It verifies that no reboot is required (EL7, EL8, Debian/Ubuntu)
* It verifies that entropy is over 250 (critical) or 500 (warning)
