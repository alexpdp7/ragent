ragent is my Rust learning project (so it's implementation sucks, PRs, issues and suggestions welcome).

ragent is my own monitoring agent:

* It works with Nagios (with check_ragent)
* It is as simple and lightweight as possible

USAGE

$ ragent

Will start ragent listening at *:21488

$ check_ragent http://host:21488/

Will contact a ragent instance at http://host:21488/ and generate output/perfdata/return code following Nagios guidelines.
